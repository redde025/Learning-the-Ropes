Here is a better looking photo gallery website that I made with bootstrap and font.awesome.
Its more dynamic and scales to size for different screen sizes, and has an active dropdown menu.
Each tag in the drop down menu and navbar are working achor tags but dont go anywhere as it is a single page website.
